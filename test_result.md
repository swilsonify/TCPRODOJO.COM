# Test Results - TC Pro Dojo Media Gallery

## Original User Problem Statement
Complete the Media Gallery Manager implementation with full CRUD functionality for managing photos and videos across different sections of the website.

## Testing Protocol

### Communication Guidelines
1. **Before invoking testing agent**: Main agent MUST update this file with:
   - Current implementation status
   - Specific areas to test
   - Any known issues or concerns

2. **Testing agent responsibilities**:
   - Update this file with test results
   - Mark each test as ✅ PASSED, ⚠️ WARNING, or ❌ FAILED
   - Provide detailed error messages for failures
   - Return summary in response

3. **After testing**: Main agent MUST:
   - Read updated test results
   - Fix any failed tests
   - NOT repeat fixes already done by testing agent
   - Update implementation status

### Test Priority
1. Backend API endpoints (MUST test first)
2. Frontend functionality (test after backend is confirmed working)
3. End-to-end user workflows

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed
- ✅ Created GalleryModel in backend/server.py
- ✅ Added GET /api/admin/gallery endpoint (list all items, sorted by displayOrder)
- ✅ Added POST /api/admin/gallery endpoint (create new items)
- ✅ Added PUT /api/admin/gallery/{item_id} endpoint (update items)
- ✅ Added DELETE /api/admin/gallery/{item_id} endpoint (delete items)
- ✅ All endpoints protected with JWT authentication
- ✅ Backend restarted successfully
- ✅ AdminGallery.js frontend component exists with full UI
- ✅ Routing configured in App.js
- ✅ Dashboard link added in AdminDashboard.js

### Testing Required
1. **Backend Testing** (Priority 1):
   - Login with admin credentials (elizabeth/Kitch3n3r22)
   - Get auth token from login
   - Test POST /api/admin/gallery - Create gallery item with:
     * title: "Test Hero Image"
     * section: "home-hero"
     * type: "image"
     * url: "https://i.imgur.com/test.jpg"
     * description: "Test description"
     * displayOrder: 1
   - Test GET /api/admin/gallery - List all items (should return array with created item)
   - Test PUT /api/admin/gallery/{id} - Update the created item (change title to "Updated Hero Image")
   - Test DELETE /api/admin/gallery/{id} - Delete the created item
   - Verify all responses return proper status codes and data

2. **Frontend Testing** (Priority 2):
   - Admin login flow
   - Gallery page loads
   - Add media form works
   - Edit media item works
   - Delete media item works
   - Filter by section works
   - Image preview displays correctly
